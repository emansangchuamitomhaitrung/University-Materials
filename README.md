My digital notebooks, you may find in-class notes and exercises solutions, please use it at your own risk and pardon my mistakes:
- Semester 20211 (Calculus III, Technical Writing & Presentation, Probability & Statistics, and Fundamentals of Optimisation): [Link-20211](https://husteduvn-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/vu_hl204897_sis_hust_edu_vn/EruFqSl7vBtBgnu_KSFq3soB_C31MideLedEXqivguSzEg?e=QhV4Et)

In each subfolder, you may find the following files (not necessarily those exact files, depending how lazy I was at the time I organised them):
- References: You may find important text books (mostly in English, and some Vietnamese stuff) and their solutions if you are lucky enough.
- Slides - [Prof name]: Lecture slides (used at the time I uploaded), OWNED BY THE PROFESSORS.
- Slides (Annotated): The same lecture slides, but with some ugly handwritten notes, annotated by me, please read my annotations at your own risk, sometimes I, myself, am surprised at how stupid I was when I check those notes back.
- Reviews: Some old tests and short exercises, maybe helpful for you to review your knowledge, or just to realise how desperate you are when you have studied no sh*t and the exam is due tomorrow.
- Notebook: My ugly handwritten notebook, owned by me, and please use it at your own risk.
